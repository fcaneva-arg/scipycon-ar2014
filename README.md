SciPyCon.Ar 2014
================

Here you can find things that I collected or created during the SciPyCon.Ar,
the *Scientific Python Conference Argentina*, which took place on the [Centro 
Historico of Universidad Nacional del Sur][1], at Bah√≠a Blanca, Buenos Aires, 
Argentina during the week of 20th to 24th of October of 2014.

Enjoy! :)
